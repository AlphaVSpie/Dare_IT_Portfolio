# About me
My name is Valeria Sukhanova, I have thoroughly decided to master a new profession for me - Software Testing. I am a bachelor's degree in Project Management. I have thought many times about starting a career in IT and this is the most exciting of all the attempts. Previously, I took courses in manual testing and received a certificate. Now I am completing courses in automated testing and at the same time getting a certificate in Python.

Here I will share my little works that I have done during the training. I am open and motivated to improve my skills and abilities in this area.

At the moment, in search of a good company to start my work and realize my potential.

#### My Experience
My experience in project management, customer service and sales has taught me the importance of attention to detail and the ability to work well under pressure. Also experience in sourcing has taught me how to identify and troubleshoot problems, skills that are applicable to software testing.
